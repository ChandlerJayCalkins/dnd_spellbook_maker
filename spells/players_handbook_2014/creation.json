If the object is composed of multiple materials, use the shortest duration.\n<table>\nMaterial | Duration\n<row> Vegetable matter | 1 day\n<row> Stone or crystal | 12 hours\n<row> Precious metals | 1 hour\n<row> Gems | 10 minutes\n<row> Adamentine or mithral | 1 minute\n<table>\nUsing any material created by this spell as another spell's material component causes that spell to fail.",
