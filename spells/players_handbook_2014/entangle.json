For the duration, these plants turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain.\nA creature in the area when you cast the spell must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by the entangling plants until the spell ends. A creature restrained by the plants can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.\nWhen the spell ends, the conjured plants wilt away.",
