Any creature in the area when the spell is cast is also outlined in light if it fails a Dexterity saving throw. For the duration, objects and affected creatures shed dim light in a 10-foot radius.\nAny attack roll against an affected creature or object has advantage if the attacker can see it, and the affected creature or object can't benefit from being invisible.",
