Until the curse ends, the target suffers one of the following effects of your choice:\n- Choose one ability. The target has Disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws made with that ability.\n- The target has Disadvantage on attack rolls against you.\n- In combat, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns or be forced to take the Dodge action on that turn.\n- If you deal damage to the target with an attack roll or a spell, the target takes an extra 1d8 Necrotic damage.",
