Three bolts then leap from that target to as many as three other targets of your choice, each of which must be within 30 feet of the first target. A target can be a creature or an object and can be targeted by only one of the bolts.\nEach target makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d8 Lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.",
