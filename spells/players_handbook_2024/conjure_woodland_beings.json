Whenever the Emanation enters the space of a creature you can see and whenever a creature you can see enters the Emanation or ends its turn there, you can force that creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. The creature takes 5d8 Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature makes this save only once per turn.\nIn addition, you can take the Disengage action as a Bonus Action for the spell's duration.",
