	"description": "Choose a spell of level 5 or lower that you can cast, that has a casting time of an action, and that can target you. You cast that spell—called the contingent spell—as part of casting <i> Contingency, <r> expending spell slots for both, but the contingent spell doesn't come into effect. Instead, it takes effect when a certain trigger occurs. You describe that trigger when you cast the two spells. For example, a <i> Contingency <r> cast with <i> Water Breathing <r> might stipulate that <i> Water Breathing <r> comes into effect when you are engulfed in water or a similar liquid.\nThe contingent spell takes effect immediately after the trigger occurs for the first time, whether or not you want it to, and then <i> Contingency <r> ends.\nThe contingent spell takes effect only on you, even if it can normally target others. You can use only one <i> Contingency <r> spell at a time. If you cast this spell again, the effect of another <i> Contingency <r> spell on you ends. Also, <i> Contingency <r> ends on you if its material component is ever not on your person.",
