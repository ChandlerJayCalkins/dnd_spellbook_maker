If you sense such effects, you can take the Magic action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears the magic, and if an effect was created by a spell, you learn the spell's school of magic.\nThe spell is blocked by 1 foot of stone, dirt, or wood; 1 inch of metal; or a thin sheet of lead.",
