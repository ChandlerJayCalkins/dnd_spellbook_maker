	"description": "You sense any trap within range that is within line of sight. A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes any object or mechanism that was created to cause damage or other danger. Thus, the spell would sense the <i> Alarm <r> or <i> Glyph of Warding <r> spell or a mechanical pit trap, but it wouldn't reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.\nThis spell reveals that a trap is present but not its location. You do learn the general nature of the danger posed by a trap you sense.",
