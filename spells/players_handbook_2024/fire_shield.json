The warm shield grants you Resistance to Cold damage, and the chill shield grants you Resistance to Fire damage.\nIn addition, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack roll, the shield erupts with flame. The attacker takes 2d8 Fire damage from a warm shield or 2d8 Cold damage from a chill shield.",
