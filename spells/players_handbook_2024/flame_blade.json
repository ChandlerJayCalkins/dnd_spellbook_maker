If you let go of the blade, it disappears, but you can evoke it again as a Bonus Action.\nAs a Magic action, you can make a melee spell attack with the fiery blade. On a hit, the target takes Fire damage equal to 3d6 plus your spellcasting ability modifier.\nThe flaming blade sheds Bright Light in a 10-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 10 feet.",
