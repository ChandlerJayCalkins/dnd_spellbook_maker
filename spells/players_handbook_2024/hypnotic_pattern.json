Each creature in the area who can see the pattern must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Charmed condition for the duration. While Charmed, the creature has the Incapacitated condition and a Speed of 0.\nThe spell ends for an affected creature if it takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its stupor.",
