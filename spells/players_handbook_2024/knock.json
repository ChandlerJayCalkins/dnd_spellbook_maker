If the object has multiple locks, only one of them is unlocked.\nIf the target is held shut by <i> Arcane Lock, <r> that spell is suppressed for 10 minutes, during which time the target can be opened and closed.\nWhen you cast the spell, a loud knock, audible up to 300 feet away, emanates from the target.",
