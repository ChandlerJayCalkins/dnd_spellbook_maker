If the creature is moving, you know the direction of its movement.\nThe spell can locate a specific creature known to you or the nearest creature of a specific kind (such as a human or a unicorn) if you have seen such a creature up close—within 30 feet—at least once. If the creature you described or named is in a different form, such as under the effects of a <i> Flesh to Stone <r> or <i> Polymorph <r> spell, this spell doesn't locate the creature.\nThis spell can't locate a creature if any thickness of lead blocks a direct path between you and the creature.",
