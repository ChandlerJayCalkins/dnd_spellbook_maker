If the object is in motion, you know the direction of its movement.\nThe spell can locate a specific object known to you if you have seen it up close—within 30 feet—at least once. Alternatively, the spell can locate the nearest object of a particular kind, such as a certain kind of apparel, jewelry, furniture, tool, or weapon.\nThis spell can't locate an object if any thickness of lead blocks a direct path between you and the object.",
