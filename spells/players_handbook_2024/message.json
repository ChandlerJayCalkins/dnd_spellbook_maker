The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.\nYou can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence; 1 foot of stone, metal, or wood; or a thin sheet of lead blocks the spell.",
