The cloud lingers in the air for the duration or until a strong wind (such as the one created by <i> Gust of Wind<r>) disperses it.\nEach creature that starts its turn in the Sphere must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have the Poisoned condition until the end of the current turn. While Poisoned in this way, the creature can't take an action or a Bonus Action.",
